# Feasibility Check

### **1. Market Validation**

- **Problem Identification:**
    - Have you clearly identified the exact pain points or needs of your target users (companies, potential clients, government agencies, investors)?
        - I didn’t yet validate the pain points of targetted users, but I didn’t found such a service in the french area.
    - What data or evidence do you have to confirm this need actually exists?
        - I need to dig deeper into it, any help on how to actually confirm this need would be highly appreciated.
- **User Interest & Demand:**
    - How have you tested that potential users genuinely care about or need such a directory?
        - If it’s a free service and that they can check and compare easily all services, I don’t see why this wouldn’t be a great service.
    - Is there existing evidence of demand (surveys, interviews, existing products)?
        - Directories exist since always, and I don’t see why there would be no demand in a world where today specialising is key.
- **Competition Analysis:**
    - Are there similar platforms or services currently operating?
        - There are some in english but none in french categorizing french tools
    - If yes, how is your solution clearly superior or differentiated enough to attract users?
        - It focus on french companies only to let users choose france over products elsewhere first

### **2. Feasibility and Technology**

- **Technical Simplicity & Data Management:**
    - Using Google Sheets as your backend: Are you confident in its ability to scale and maintain reliability as traffic grows?
        - Google sheets today is to have a free and fast way to use data but as soon as we will grow, we will need to change the database structure
    - What technical challenges might arise when using Google Sheets as your data storage (security, performance, data limits, concurrency)?
        - performance will be an issue that we will fix once we have revenue.
- **Data Accuracy & Updating:**
    - How will you manage the accuracy and currency of the data?
        - We will send weekly/monthly email to the owner of the page to confirm accuracy, and if there is no reply after 3 emails, we will let the user know that data might not be accurate and after 6 months of inactivity, we might delete the page altogether.
    - Is there a clear, automated method for companies to update their information, or will this be manual?
        - At the beginning, we will use a form online to update the data and we will do it manually, hopefully can be automatic with some API and when we are stable enough we will create page management for each company owner.
- **Technological Stack & Skills:**
    - Do you or your team possess sufficient experience and skills in React, TypeScript, Material UI, and Google Sheets API integrations?
        - Maybe I don’t, but when we have revenue, we will be able to outsource the maintenance of the code. And I have Chat GPT help :)
    - What specific technical skills or experience might your team currently lack?
        - Marketing and sales

### **3. Monetization and Business Model**

- **Revenue Streams:**
    - How exactly will your directory generate revenue? Ads, premium listings, sponsored content, data access, subscriptions?
        - We will use:
            - Ads on certain page
            - use affiliate links when available
            - Subscription for certain users
    - Have you quantified the potential market size and expected revenue based on real-world comparables?
        - Not at all, I would need help on that, but the idea is at the beginning to generate extra income on the side, so if I could react 5-10k MRR it would be great
- **Cost Management:**
    - Have you mapped out clear initial costs (development, hosting, support)?
        - I am hoping to keep it at a minimum for now, less than 1k / year
    - Are ongoing operational costs clearly understood and manageable?
        - Absolutely

### **4. Marketing and Growth Strategy**

- **Customer Acquisition:**
    - What specific marketing strategies will you employ to attract users to your directory?
        - Promotion on specific groups in Reddit in Twitter
        - Promotion on Linkedin with engagement post
        - SEO articles to compare existing products
        - Video of testing new products
    - Have you estimated the cost of customer acquisition and tested initial traction channels?
        - Not yet, I hope that it will be free to gain new companies and that visitors will go with SEO content
- **Partnerships and Collaborations:**
    - How will you encourage tech companies to join your platform initially? What incentives do they have to update their information regularly?
        - They can reach new users and place themselves in front of the competition easily.

### **5. Risks & Sustainability**

- **Risks Identification:**
    - Have you clearly identified key risks (technical, market, regulatory)?
        - Anyone can copy the idea once it’s launched and with more budget will kill the business
        - If too many companies apply, we risk to have to much work to update the db
        - Payment on affiliation may be hard to follow up
    - What is your mitigation plan for each identified risk?
        - We can’t do anything if someone as more money other than raise money (bank. Angel)
        - We will have to use agent to automatize the work
        - We will have to track actions on the buttons and ask users if they have actually subscribed or not
- **Long-Term Sustainability:**
    - Do you have plans or strategies to ensure your business remains relevant and valuable to users in the long run?
        - Not yet

### **6. Legal and Regulatory Considerations**

- **Compliance:**
    - Have you considered potential legal requirements, such as GDPR compliance (especially since you’ll manage business and possibly personal data)?
        - Yes we will be compliant
    - Are there regulations or standards specific to directories or promotional platforms in France?
        - not of my knowledge, we will check with the legal team.

### **7. Value Proposition and Differentiation**

- **Clarity of Proposition:**
    - Can you succinctly state your unique value proposition in one clear sentence?
        - Le premier répertoire de logiciel français en France
    - Is this uniqueness compelling enough for your target users to choose your directory over other available solutions?
        - Yes, I don’t see why not, since the french population don’t speak english
